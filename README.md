Project Description of Landslide Risk Assessment to Assist in Critical
Infrastructure Planning in Northeastern Part of USA
With the increase in population and consequent climate change, the number of hazards
has risen gradually.

**Problem statement:** Among the natural hazards, landslides are among the most
dangerous natural disasters, resulting in significant economic damage and human deaths
worldwide. Comprehensive disaster management strategies must be devised and
implemented to deal with natural risks.

**Objective:** The proposed work aims to assess the risk of landslides in the northeastern
part of the United States and provide sufficient information to assist in critical
infrastructure planning (hospitals, power plants, bridges), development, and upgrade
strategies.

**Methodology:** To achieve the objective, data related to topography, foliage cover,
precipitation, and other geographically related factors will be collected. The
geographically related data will then be merged together to form a complete training set.
The main challenge lies in merging the datasets as the data's resolution to be combined
differs in each case. The data preprocessing (data cleaning, replacing missing values) will
be performed. It will then be used to train a binary classifier that will predict the
probability of a landslide occurring at a particular geographic location. The labels of the
final dataset will be derived from NASA's landslide dataset.

**Results:** A well-trained model will be delivered that can be utilized to predict the risk of
the landslide at a given set of coordinates. A map that depicts the landslide risk will be
delivered. The results obtained will be communicated via necessary visualization tools.

**Keywords:** Landslide, NASA, Northeastern USA, Critical Infrastructure, Binary
Classifier, Map.
